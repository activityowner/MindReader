' When run, the Add-in wizard prepared the registry for the Add-in.
' At a later time, if the Add-in becomes unavailable for reasons such as:
'   1) You moved this project to a computer other than which is was originally created on.
'   2) You chose 'Yes' when presented with a message asking if you wish to remove the Add-in.
'   3) Registry corruption.
' you will need to re-register the Add-in by building the AORibbonSetup project, 
' right click the project in the Solution Explorer, then choose install.
